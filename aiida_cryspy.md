# CrySPY for aiida_cryspy

## changes

CrySPY reads files 'cryspy.in', 'cryspy.stat' and serialized files inside the function.
It becomes difficult to understand the flowchart and input/output.

This package changes that functions directly pass the arguments to the functions to make it clear the flow of the variables.
